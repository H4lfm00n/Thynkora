# Spark-to-Action

A modern web application that implements the **Spark-to-Action Model** - a simple, adaptable, and actionable framework for transforming ideas into reality.

## 🚀 The Spark-to-Action Model

This model consists of two distinct phases designed to keep you organized and motivated:

### Phase 1: Capture
- **Purpose**: Collect and store all your ideas, thoughts, and inspirations
- **Principle**: Don't filter - just capture everything that comes to mind
- **Benefit**: Prevents idea loss and creates a repository of potential projects

### Phase 2: Execute
- **Purpose**: Transform captured sparks into actionable steps
- **Principle**: Break down ideas into concrete, manageable actions
- **Benefit**: Turns inspiration into tangible progress
